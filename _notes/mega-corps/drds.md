# 2. Origin Story (Contextual Background)

**Founded:** Mid-Reconstruction Era (cross-Pacific industrial merger)  

**Historical Narrative:**  
DRDS was formed through the merger of:

- **Daegu Heavy Industries** — a Korean industrial conglomerate known for precision metallurgy, robotics, and armored vehicle production.
- **Ravensdale Tactical Works** — a Cascadian munitions and ballistics manufacturer originally based in the town of Ravensdale, east of Sound City.

Ravensdale Tactical Works began as a regional supplier during early Coalition consolidation and gained a reputation for rugged, reliable urban firearms. As Coalition procurement modernized, Ravensdale partnered with Daegu Heavy Industries to expand vertically and internationally.

The merger created a fully integrated defense manufacturer with Pacific Rim scale and Cascadian roots.

**Foundational Myth:**
- Combined Korean metallurgical precision with Cascadian battlefield pragmatism  
- Stabilized fragmented defense supply chains  
- Standardized elite Coalition enforcement equipment  
- Reduced equipment failure rates during high-intensity urban deployments  
- “Forged Pacific steel for Cascadian security”
